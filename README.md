# Neural-Network-Approximation

This project explores the theoretical and practical limits of approximating univariate convex functions using piecewise-linear neural networks (ReLU-based).

---

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Approximate convex functions using ReLU networks
- Evaluate performance across different architectures
- Compare with theoretical approximation bounds
- Understand the limitations of classical neural regressors
